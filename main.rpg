 The  %TRIM  built-in function is used to remove trailing blanks from the strings. 
 The  printf  prototype is defined with the  OPTIONS(*VARSIZE)  keyword. This allows the  printf  procedure to accept a variable-length string as an argument. 
 The  printf  procedure is called twice, once for each string. 
 The  *INLR  indicator is set on to end the program. 
 Compile the program with the following command: 
 CRTBNDC PGM(MYLIB/HELLO) SRCFILE(MYLIB/QCLSRC) SRCMBR(HELLO)
 
 Run the program with the following command: 
 CALL MYLIB/HELLO
 
 The program will display the following output: 
 Hello, World!Hello, Johnny!
 
 The program displays the two strings with the trailing blanks removed. 
 The  %TRIM  built-in function is used to remove trailing blanks from a string. 
 The  OPTIONS(*VARSIZE)  keyword is used in the prototype to allow the  printf  procedure to accept a variable-length string as an argument.
