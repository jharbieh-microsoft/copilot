## A bit of History
AI > ML > DL > GI

* 1956 Artificial Intelligence (AI) - field of computer science that seeks to create intelligent machines that can replicate or exceed human intelligence
* 1997 Machine Learning (ML) - subset of AI that enables machines to learn from existing data and improve upon that data to make decisions or predictions
* 2017 Deep Learning (DL) - machine learning technique in which layers of neural networks are used to process data and make decisions
* 2021 Generative AI (GI) - a new class of AI that can generate new content, such as text, images, and code

## OpenAI + Microsoft Offerings
* GPT-3 (generate and understand text)
* Codex (generate and understand code)
* Dall-E (generate images from text prompts)
