This repo has one goal in mind. Document, practice and show examples of how to use Copilot. Along the way, authoritative content on the topic of Generative AI will be represented here. 

## A bit of History
AI > ML > DL > GI

* 1956 Artificial Intelligence (AI) - field of computer science that seeks to create intelligent machines that can replicate or exceed human intelligence
* 1997 Machine Learning (ML) - subset of AI that enables machines to learn from existing data and improve upon that data to make decisions or predictions
* 2017 Deep Learning (DL) - machine learning technique in which layers of neural networks are used to process data and make decisions
* 2021 Generative AI (GI) - a new class of AI that can generate new content, such as text, images, and code

## OpenAI + Microsoft Offerings
* GPT (generate and understand text)
* Codex (generate and understand code)
* Dall-E (generate images from text prompts)

## Introduction to Copilot by Copilot
Copilot is a new AI-powered coding assistant that helps you write code faster and with fewer bugs. 

You can receive suggestions from GitHub Copilot either by starting to write the code you want to use, or by writing a natural language comment describing what you want the code to do.
