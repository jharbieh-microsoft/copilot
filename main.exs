# create a hello world prgram that will return a text string saying hello world in Elixir

IO.puts "Hello World"

# to run this program, we need to compile it first

# to compile, we need to run the following command in the terminal

# elixirc hello_world.ex

# this will create a file called Elixir.HelloWorld.beam


# to run the compiled file, we need to run the following command in the terminal

# elixir -e Elixir.HelloWorld.beam

# this will output Hello World in the terminal

# we can also run the code directly without compiling it by running the following command in the terminal

# elixir hello_world.ex

# this will output Hello World in the terminal

# we can also run the code in the interactive shell by running the following command in the terminal

# iex hello_world.ex

# this will output Hello World in the terminal

# to exit the interactive shell, we need to run the following command in the terminal

# exit

# this will exit the interactive shell in the terminal

# we can also run the code in the interactive shell by running the following command in the terminal

# iex

# this will open the interactive shell in the terminal

# to exit the interactive shell, we need to run the following command in the terminal

# exit

# this will exit the interactive shell in the terminal

# we can also run the code in the interactive shell by running the following command in the terminal

# iex -S mix

# this will open the interactive shell in the terminal

# to exit the interactive shell, we need to run the following command in the terminal

# exit

# this will exit the interactive shell in the terminal

# we can also run the code in the interactive shell by running the following command in the terminal

# iex -S mix

# this will open the interactive shell in the terminal

# to exit the interactive shell, we need to run the following command in the terminal

# exit

# this will exit the interactive shell in the terminal

# we can also run the code in the interactive shell by running the following command in the terminal
